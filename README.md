# HTML_Worksheet

<h2>Section 1 - Paragraphs and Headers</h2>
Alter the "Heading" to their corresponding "h" tag.<br>
<br>
<h2>Section 2 - Lists and Tables</h2>
<h3>Lists</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Create unordered list with three favorite movies.</li>
    <li>Create ordered list with same movies</li>
</ol>
<h3>Tables</h3>
Add a header row to the table, left column labeled "Star Trek" and right column labeled "Star Wars".<br>
<br>
<h2>Section 3 - Attributes</h2>
Give this div an attribute with the name <b>id</b> and the value <b>"target"</b>. We will shortly be using this id as the target of a hyperlink.<br>
<br>
<h2>Section 4 - Hyperlinks and Formatting</h2>
Correct the formatting of the "&lt;p&gt;" so that the paragraph is formatted seemlessly with its siblings.<br>
Create your own link that will take you back up to the div that you gave the id of "target."<br>
<br>
<h2>Section 5 - Images</h2>
There should be an image called "coffee.jpg" included in this folder. Add it to this page in an img tag. Since its in the same folder, you can just enter the filename itself in the src="". Also make sure to come up with a descriptive string for the alt"<br>
<br>
<h2>Section 6 - Semantic Elements</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>Add a &lt;footer&gt; element below this section to say "Completed by YourName". Notice that it gets placed right where the element is.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Now make it a true footer by cutting and pasting it to the bottom of the document, after the &lt;main&gt; element (but still inside the &lt;body&gt;)</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<br>
<h2>Section 7 - Inline vs Block</h2>
Change the line of span tags to div to see the difference.<br>
<br>
<h2>Final Task</h2>
<p>Your final task for this sheet is to go back to Section Overview at the top of the page and turn it into a functional NavBar section. To accomplish this, you will need to add ids to the various sections throughout the document, and change the list items into links that will take you to them. That way, this sheet will serve as a handy reference when you build more websites! Also take a look at the available semantic elements and decide which one seems most appropriate for a NavBar, then wrap the whole NavBar in its own semantic element.</p>
